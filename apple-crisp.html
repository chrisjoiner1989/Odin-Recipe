      <h1>Apple Crisp</h1>
      <p>
        This apple crisp showcases apples at their best! The combination of
        warm, tender apples and the crunchy oat topping is one of my favorite
        desserts. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

        <h2>How to Make Apple Crisp</h2>
        <p>
          You'll find a full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief
          overview of what you can expect when you make homemade apple crisp:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Place the apples in a baking dish.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle the apples with white sugar, flour, and cinnamon.</li>
          <li>Drizzle water over the apples.</li>
          <li>Make the oat topping, then sprinkle it over the apples.</li>
          <li>
            Bake until the topping is golden brown and the apple mixture is
            bubbly.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Does Apple Crisp Need to Be Refrigerated?</h2>

        <p>
          Yes. Allow the crisp to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers
          to an airtight container or cover the dish tightly with foil. Store in
          the refrigerator for about three days.
        </p>

        <h2>Can You Freeze Apple Crisp?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! You can freeze apple crisp. If you plan to freeze it, it's best
          to go ahead and bake it in a foil pan. Wrap the whole thing tightly in
          a layer of storage wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up
          to three months.

        </p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
